            <h3>Puzzle Number 1 - Aviva</h3>
            <p> In the first couple days of living in the house, we uncovered an 1,000 piece puzzle that was calling our
                names for a wine night. Featuring a Thoreau quote and a scenic pink sky, the puzzle was just hard enough
                that we weren't bored by it, but not too hard that we got frustrated and stopped (like the next one we
                bought). Aviva and I spent days taking study breaks by going to work on this puzzle with a "bevragino", not really wanting
                the process to ever end but also feeling such satisfaction whenever a section was finished. "It was a
                great bonding activity." This puzzle is what ultimately gave the Puzzle Room it's name. Even though we
                didn't break out another puzzle in there for months (we just started a new one to distract from thesis,
                stay tuned), it remained a feature decor piece. "It was just a more fun name then the family room." The
                renaming also helped avoid confusion with the living room.

            <h3>The Package Princess - Fran</h3>
            <p> Fran was the reigning package queen of the house for the entire first semester. Almost every day there
                would be a text in the groupchat - "package for Fran in the puzzle room." That is, until our new
                roommate Grace moved in late February and took her throne, receiving multiple packages almost every
                single day. It's beyond all of us what these two are ordering, but alas. "It was a sad day" when Fran
                lost her title as the package queen, but we reached a compromise. "Two packages for GL the package queen
                and one for Fran the package princess in the puzzle room" a text read out. And a response from Fran,
                "I've always wanted to be a princess."
