            <h3>Hello Rufus - Shayla </h3>
            <p> For a while in the winter we had an infamous 8th roomate, Rufus the mouse. "Oh my god, we should'nt even
                speak his name." Rufus kept the weirdest hours of any mouse to ever live. He would only be active from
                2pm-7pm despite Google assuring us that mice were nocturnal. For a while, I didn't believe Rufus was
                real despite Shayla announcing herself with a scream any time she entered a room to scare him off. I
                decided to brave the first floor where he lived to do some work at the kitchen table when all of a
                sudden Shayla appears and tells me to look down. "Ummm, Rufus was under your chair." She immediately ran
                away, leaving me to fend for myself.

            <h3>Friendsgiving - Emily </h3>
            <p> "It was so wholesome." Friendsgiving was our last hurrah together before everyone scattered for the
                actual holiday. Emily secured the recipe for her grandma's mac and cheese, which was actually the best
                mac and cheese I've ever had. We decorated the table and took lots of Instagram stories of clinking
                glasses and the spread of food. It's not that often that we all have the time to get together like this
                and eat as a house so having excuses to do so always feel special.

            <h3>Poppers - Liz </h3>
            <p> Liz is our resident holiday enthusiast. For every season change, you can bet she's going to TJ Maxx to
                find some new decorations. For the Christmas season, she found some holiday gnomes and Christmas poppers
                to open at our last dinner together. "They're so fun!" The prizes inside ranged from a mini yo-yo to a
                tiny roll of tape, all equally unique and weird. "They even came in handy" that night when we needed a
                piece of tap and a pencil. Though the prizes were promptly abandonded within 24 hours of popping them
                open, they still made for a fun evening.
