            <h3>Banana Bread - Fran</h3>
            <p> Fran is not the most skilled cook in the house. In fact, she mostly relies on Trader Joe's frozen meals
                to get by. But one day, she decided that she was gonna be bold and attempt to make a banana bread. "You
                can't mess up banana bread, right?" she questioned as she stirred the bowl of ingredients. We all
                assured her it was nearly impossible - we were wrong. "Oh gosh, what in the world was I thinking."
                Within minutes, it smelled like something was burning, and she took a look in the oven to find that the
                batter had spilled over the sides to the bottom of the oven. In the pan still was a gooey mess of raw
                batter and crispy edges (which she ate with a spoon and claimed to be "so yummy still"). Though her
                first foray into baking didn't go quite as planned, Franny did redeem herself the next week when she
                tried again, this time with some help from a friend.

            <h3>TikTok Queens - Amy</h3>
            <p> "You know it's a good night when we start making TikToks." And such was the case on Emily's birthday.
                At the end of the night, we ended up in the kitchen looking for an activity when Amy
                suggested we make a TikTok. For context, we cannot go a single conversation in this house without a
                TikTok reference, but we have to be in a certain state to start making them ourselves. The videos are
                never to see the light of day but we have so much fun making them, dancing to the camera and sound
                bites. Amy's favorite from this night is one to the audio "she's a runner, she's a trackstar" which
                featured us running around the house at full speed. "Chaos."
