            <h3>Love Island - Liz</h3>
            <p> Liz's one true goal in the begining of the year was to get all of us to watch something together, this
                thing being Love Island. Having spent the previous semester abroad in England, she had become hooked on
                the show and knew it was something we could all bond over and enjoy together. Though it took a couple
                episodes to gain traction, eventually we got everyone in the room together to watch. "My dream come
                true!" We would stay up watching until 2 in the morning, wanting to see how the cliffhangers on each
                episode would play out. After 7 weeks, we finished all 50 episodes of the season. For a while, the
                living room was dubbed the "Love Island Room" in the same way that the Puzzle Room was named. Though
                this name didn't stick the same way, it encapsulates how much time we spent in there watching the show
                in the early days of the house and what an impact it had on our bonding as friends.

            <h3>K-Pop Dramas - Shayla</h3>
            <p> I know that if I'm ever looking for someone to ignore work and watch a movie with that Shayla is the
                girl to go to. She is a big fan of k-dramas, or as I mistakenly called them once, k-pop dramas (which I
                will never live down). It was the one and only time she convinced me to start a k-drama with her. While
                I enjoyed it, I didn't like that I couldn't multitask while watching since I had to be paying attention
                to the subtitles. Beyond just these shows, we've also binged entire seasons of Netflix series (like Dash
                and Lily) in a single day as a distraction. "You know I'm always down to watch a rom-com!" The most
                classic instance is when I was in the living room doing work late and Shayla got home and somehow
                convinced me to watch a rom-com with Hugh Grant until 2am instead.

            <h3>"I'm just resting my eyes" - Liz and Fran</h3>
            <p> Liz and Fran are culprits of dozing off while we're watching something but refusing to go upstairs to
                bed, not wanting to miss anything. "I'm just resting my eyes." We tease them every single time, but they
                remain convinced that they're still paying attention. "No, no, I'm awake."
