            <h3>Pics on Pics - Emily</h3>
            <p> The sun room has become the house photo room for all occassions. First day of the semester? Dressing
                ourselves up for a house dinner? You can bet we're having a photo shoot with over 200 options to be
                uploaded into the shared album. This specific memory comes from the night featured in our profile
                pictures. We dressd up like it was thee 1920's and made dinner to eat together that night. But
                afterwards, we ended up in the sun room, finishing off our drinks and taking some incredibly funny and
                candid pictures. "You can tell it was the end of the night" from the photos, especially in the case of
                Emily who had ditched her dress in favor of a sweatshirt. But she joined in the festivities
                nevertheless.

            <h3>Yikes - Amy</h3>
            <p> Early in the first semester, when it was still warm and sunny out, the sun room used to be a popular
                spot to take Zoom classes. Me and Amy were popular contenders for taking the room for the day. But I
                lost my competition to get it in October when Amy spotted the "biggest bug" she's ever seen in there.
                She "literally screamed" and ran out of the room, and she "has not studied in there since. Can't risk
                another exposure." Hopefully we're out of here before cicada season infests the sun room and renders it
                a bug zone once again.
