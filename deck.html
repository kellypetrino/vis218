            <h3>Come "Study" - Aviva</h3>
            <p> With the nice weather of the last few weeks, we've been spending an insane amount of time outside on the
                porch. Every day I get a "come outside and study with me" text from Aviva, drawing everyone out of the
                house to take advantage of the porch and enjoy the sun. "But we never really get anything done out
                there." So quickly the concept of doing work in the sunshine descends into tanning and talking ("and
                sometimes margaritas"). We should feel guilty about it, but it's senior spring. And sometimes you just
                have to justify avoiding work with the excuse of enjoying your dwindling days in Princeton.

            <h3>Spooky Scary - Liz</h3>
            <p> I'm a big fan of Halloween, and so is Liz. At home, my family goes all out with big candy bars and
                decorations, and I was sad to miss it. So, I was thankful when Liz also wanted to go all out with me.
                "We had too! The kids in costumes were so cute!" We bundled up little baggies of candy and put them out
                on a table for the kids to take while we sat on the porch from a distance and watched. In the mean time,
                we leaarned a TikTok dance to the song "Spooky Scary Skeletons." Our roommates laughed and took videos
                as we did the dance over and over (while our neighboors stared, the real spooky scary part).
